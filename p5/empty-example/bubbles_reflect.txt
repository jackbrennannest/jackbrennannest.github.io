    A javascript objects are single variables that contain multible different properties like diameter and color. The advantage of
using an object is that you are able to use only one variable for multiple different valuse in order to make an image or something
else of that nature. I didn't have any difficulty in using objects but my main problem was that I was not able to run the program.
This was because I kept running the apache50 from the empty-example file insted of from the p5 directory. Once I was told that this
was the problem I was able to run the program.
